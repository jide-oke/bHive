The School_ID is essentially tied to the Clever ID, which stores all historical data for that record type.\n\nIf we change the field that Clever uses for the School_ID from `schools.id` to `schools.school_number`, this will cause the School_ID and Clever ID to change. This would match up with the School_ID your district is currently exporting in the staff.csv, but as a result, it would appear as if the schools have entirely new accounts in Clever and within third-party applications.\n\nTo address this, we can migrate the data from the old Clever ID to the new one, ensuring the preservation of historical data for each school site. However, this process may take up to 1-2 weeks, depending on how many app partners are currently using the existing School_IDs for your district.\n\nPreserving the historical data is optional, so please let me know if you would like us to proceed with both the field change and historical data migration, or if you prefer to make the field change without preserving the historical data.

        "content": "Hello Scott ðŸ‘‹,\n\nI hope you're having a pleasant day! Thank you for reaching out to Clever Support. You've come to the right place, and I'm here to assist with your inquiry.\n\nThe issue your district is encountering seems to stem from a mismatch between the data in the **School_ID** column in the **staff.csv** file and the data currently being rostered from your district's PowerSchool instance into Clever. Below is a screenshot of the latest data exported in the staff.csv file.\n\nTo provide an example, let's look at **Wahpeton Senior High School**. In Clever, the **School_ID** for Wahpeton Senior High School is **'5'**, as shown in the image below.\n\nIt's important to note that Clever is not assigning these **School_IDs**. These are rostered from your district's PowerSchool instance, specifically from the **'schools.id'** field. You can review this in your district's field mappings on [this](https://schools.clever.com/sync/settings/mappings) page in the Clever Dashboard.\n\nIn other words, the **'schools.id'** field in **PowerSchool** should have a value of **'5'** for Wahpeton Senior High School to match what is rostered in Clever. This School_ID data is mapped from PowerSchool.\n\nTo resolve the issue with the staff.csv file, either you or your SIS Admin will need to configure the **staff.csv** SFTP exports to ensure that the **School_ID** matches the values being rostered from PowerSchool.\n\nFor instance, the **School_ID** for Wahpeton Senior High School should be **'5'** in the staff.csv export (from PowerSchool's **'schools.id'** field).\n\nWhile the **School_Number** for Wahpeton Senior High School is **'9170'** (from PowerSchool's **'schools.school_number'** field), the staff.csv file requires the **School_ID**, not the **School_Number**. This adjustment will need to be made by the person responsible for setting up the staff.csv exports on your district's end.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you need any further clarification or assistance.

You're in the right place, and I'm here to provide the assistance you need.\n\nI wanted to check in to see if the teacher is still experiencing issues with printing badges for the students. I believe I may have identified the cause of the issue.\n\nIt seems that the reason the teacher may be unable to print badges for students, is that students currently do not meet your district's badge criteria set on [this](https://schools.clever.com/badges/settings) page in the Clever Dashboard.\n\nSpecifically, it appears that the specific **Grade level** for all students is not populated in Clever, based on the data being received from Alma SIS.\n\nTo verify this, you can download the latest dataset Alma SIS has sent to Clever by clicking '**Download SIS File**' on the student row on [this](https://schools.clever.com/sync) page.\n\nYou'll notice that the **Grade field** is blank for all students. This is why they do not meet the badge criteria set by your district (which is to allow badges for all students from **Transitional Kindergarten** to **4th Grade**).\n\nTo resolve this, your district can either contact Alma SIS to ensure that the correct **Grade level** for each student is exported to Clever, or you may adjust the badge criteria in your Clever Dashboard to include the grade level of '**Other**'. Since all students are marked as grade level 'Other' in Clever, this will allow Clever Badges to be available for all students.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or clarification.

Thank you for reaching out to Clever Support â€” we truly appreciate it, and I'm here to assist you.\n\nBy default, primary school assignments in Clever are based on teacher and student enrollments. In this case, since [Sabrina Montalbano](https://schools.clever.com/users/66d10021990afb0331be8ebc/teacher) teaches **more** classes at **Samoset Middle School**, their primary school association has been automatically set to Samoset Middle School in Clever.\n\nHowever, we have the option to modify this logic for your district so that the primary school association is determined solely by the data provided in the **teachers.csv** file that is being rostered from **eSchoolData**, and not by the majority of sections they are enrolled in.\n\nIf you'd like us to make this adjustment for your Clever instance, please note that it will apply to all teachers within your Clever account. If I've misunderstood, please feel free to let me know, and I apologize in advance for any confusion.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm more than happy to help!\n\nKind Regards,"

The investigation is still ongoing, but so far it appears that the **Q1 term** section data may have been removed from your district's Clever instance on October 7th.\n\nWhile we are still determining the official cause, it's important to note that sections must have at least one student enrollment in order to be rostered into Clever. It's possible that if all students were unenrolled from the Q1 sections on October 7th, those sections were subsequently removed from Clever due to the lack of active enrollments.\n\nTo answer your question regarding the Formative app - If your goal is to delay any **bulk deletions** or **changes** to section data in a specific app, such as Formative, you can initiate an **App Sync Pause** from [this](https://schools.clever.com/applications/formative-rostering-dev/settings) page.\n\nThis will freeze the current data in the app, stopping any new changes from Clever's automatic sync from being sent to the app. I understand that the Q1 Term section data has already been removed from Formative, but using this feature could help prevent similar issues in the future, depending on what our team finds as the cause for the Q1 Term being removed from Clever.\n\nWe will continue to investigate and keep you updated as soon as we have more information.\n\nKind Regards,"

You'll notice that the *ext.TeacherLicenseNumber* column is still missing.\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend working with your SIS admin to ensure the *teachers.csv* file includes the *ext.TeacherLicenseNumber* column header, and then initiate a new export to Clever.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance.\n\nKind Regards,"

The Clever Teacher account is associated with **St. Joseph School - Pinole**, while the Clever Staff account is associated with both **St. Joseph School - Pinole** and **St. John the Baptist**.\n\nThe reason GoGuardian is only connected to your teacher account, and not your staff account, is due to the sharing rules for GoGuardian at St. Joseph School - Pinole, which only include teachers and students from the sections listed below. Non-teaching staff are not included.\n\nHowever, when I impersonated your teacher account with GoGuardian access, I was unable to see any students or sections there. I believe there should still be users visible in your teacher account, so I wanted to confirm if this aligns with the issue you're experiencing before proceeding with the next steps.\n\nIf needed, feel free to schedule a time to meet tomorrow or Thursday using the link below.

In the previous message, Krystal mentioned that your team could connect directly with the teacher to offer further assistance or address any additional questions. However, we haven't received any follow-up, and the issue is still ongoing for the teacher.\n\nBefore moving forward, I want to clarify a few things to ensure I understand correctly:\n\n- Are you saying that support for the ABCMouse Clever Library app is not provided by ABCMouse for the San Diego Unified School District or the teacher in question due to them not having ABCMouse Enterprise accounts?\n- If that's the case, why wasn't this made clear in ABCMouse's initial response from September 23rd? I only ask because this would have saved the district time from reaching out to ABCMouse and requesting updates, if this issue was never being addressed due to the teacher having a ABCMouse Clever Library Account.\n\nAdditionally, is this issue currently being worked on, or has the status remained unchanged since September 16th? Could you please provide an update on the current status, any progress made, the cause of the issue on ABCMouse's end, and whether this affects just this teacher or all teachers using the ABCMouse Clever Library app?\n\nPlease be as direct and thorough as possible in your response to ensure all our questions are fully addressed. This will help us avoid unnecessary follow-ups with ABCMouse Support. Please note, we're not trying to be harsh; we genuinely want to understand the status of this issue, whether it has been worked on from the start, and what we should communicate to the districts that use the ABCMouse Clever Library app.\n\nKind Regards,"

I sincerely apologize for the delay. In the meantime, I've done some research to help us understand what might be happening with Pearson - aimswebPlus. Here's what I've found:\n\n- It appears that not only student **63347ed5326be905703ca5a0** is encountering the error message when launching Pearson - aimswebPlus from Clever, but all other students in your district are experiencing the same issue when accessing Pearson - aimswebPlus through the Clever Portal.\n- In similar cases involving **Pearson - aimswebPlus**, they have indicated that they will not proceed with an **initial sync** unless all [Data Quality Errors](https://schools.clever.com/applications/pearson-aimswebplus/warnings) for the district are resolved. This means the sync may not have occurred for your district yet, as there are unresolved errors on the [Data Quality page](https://schools.clever.com/applications/pearson-aimswebplus/warnings) for Pearson - aimswebPlus.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nSince we have not heard back from Pearson - aimswebPlus, we can begin by addressing these Data Quality Errors.\n\nSpecifically, **7** students are missing **race** data in Clever, **2** teachers are missing **email** addresses, **1** teacher is missing **username** data, and **9** teachers are not currently enrolled in any sections but are shared with Pearson - aimswebPlus. It may be best to resolve the other concerns first, leaving the 9 teachers for last.

Once updated, the changes will automatically sync with Clever during the next roster update.\n\nPlease note that changing the School_ID for these schools will affect all users and classes associated with them in Clever. Since a schoolâ€™s Clever_ID is directly tied to its School_ID, such a change would require a SIS ID conversion to retain historical data.\n\nIf your SIS Admin confirms that the desired sch_schoolGUID is already correctly reflected in Infinite Campus, but the changes are not appearing in Clever, please let me know. In that case, we can arrange a screen-sharing session to troubleshoot with our engineers.\n\nTo proceed, the first step is to verify what is currently listed under the sch_schoolGUID for White Academy Middle in Infinite Campus. Your SIS Admin can provide a screenshot of this field if needed.

Iâ€™ve reviewed the backend, and you are correctâ€”the student in question is currently listed with Whitmore Lake Elementary as their primary school in PowerSchool.\n\nAt present, your Clever instance assigns a studentâ€™s primary school based on where they have the majority of their sections. However, we can modify this logic so that Clever strictly assigns the primary school based on what is listed in the SIS, rather than using section counts.\n\nPlease let me know if youâ€™d like to proceed with this change, and Iâ€™ll be happy to implement it for you. Kindly note that this update will affect all students, assigning their primary school in Clever strictly based on what is recorded in the SIS.\n\nAdditionally, for situations like this studentâ€”where the number of sections is tied across multiple schoolsâ€”Clever currently determines the primary school by selecting the school with the higher total student enrollment in those sections. If you choose to switch to strictly using PowerSchool as the source of truth, the studentâ€™s primary school, as well as all others, will align directly with whatâ€™s listed in the SIS.\n\nPlease let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed, or if you have any questionsâ€”Iâ€™m here to assist!"
